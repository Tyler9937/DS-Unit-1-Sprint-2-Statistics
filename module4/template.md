# Assignment!

Fill out the template *twice*, for two different ideas.

Then compare and contrast and select one as the idea you're leaning towards
working on for your project week.


# Ideas for data storytelling - Idea 1

## You

What do you care about?

Virtual Reality/Digital Graphics

What do you know about?

Both game and vr are graphics are inproving at a rather quick rate and
several techniques/algortihms have been used to improve rendering times and 
graphics quality.

What decisions do you face?

In a world of increasing graphics and computaional power we face the concept of
wether or not we live in a simulation.

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation

belief given their region

2. Trend related to the news

increasing amount of beleif in simulation theroy

3. Who does that?

people in the industry, people that are fans of ideas like that

4. Answering a question people care about

How many people belive in simulation theory are Elon Musk fans

5. Valuable to businesses

merchandising, concepts can be valuable to the gameing/vr industry


6. What's the most popular?

which simulation theroies are most belived in

7. Cost/Money rankings

maybe some reasearchers

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?

some of the fundemental concepts of simulation therory are usually misinterprated

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?


Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?


Could you do a new question, for the same topic?


Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?


## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?

reddit survay

# Ideas for data storytelling - Idea 2

## You

What do you care about?

3D printing

What do you know about?

printer run times and micro particle emissions

What decisions do you face?

How should consumers think and make decisions knowing the health risks

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation
wich countries are using 3d printers more

2. Trend related to the news
trends are faster and better printers, but rarley do you hear about the heath risks of these machines

3. Who does that?

people into techknology, engineers, students

4. Answering a question people care about

amount of time in a room with a 3d printer vs probability of health risk occuring

5. Valuable to businesses

3d printer manufactuers and features to reduce pollution. new companies can emerge with innovative 
filtration devices

6. What's the most popular?

which matierals/3d printers are releasing the most fumes

7. Cost/Money rankings

NA

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?

all printing materials are safe to use in housholds

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?



Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?


Could you do a new question, for the same topic?


Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?


## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?

reasearchers in the field. maybe make a survay slighly changing the goal
